# Gomoku
## About this app
[Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) is also known as Five in a Row game. This app implements the game using C# WPF. My version follows a rule where a row of five must not be blocked by both ends in order to win.

It is always fun to make a computer algorithm that can play Gomoku, so I have created a basic one inspired by [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).

You are welcome if you'd like to contribute your own version of Gomoku algorithm by creating a new [pull request](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/Gomoku/pulls) or [issue](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/Gomoku/issues).

## Technology
This app is built upon .NET Core 3.1 WPF, Visual Studio 2019. Currently supports Windows platform only.

**_Note:_** The app was originally built on .NET Framework 4.5, which is tracked under branch [legacy-net-framework](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/Gomoku/tree/legacy-net-framework).
