# Gomoku
A simple Gomoku game using C# WPF with a basic computer algorithm inspired by [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).

[Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) is also known as Five in a Row game. This version uses a rule where a row of five must not be blocked by both ends in order to win.
